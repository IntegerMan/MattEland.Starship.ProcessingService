This is a simple API for turn processing for an Angular / Redux side project I'm building at https://github.com/IntegerMan/Starship-Tech-Support

This is written in .NET Core and I'm using it as a test bed for some new technologies I want to play with as well.

Don't expect to get much out of this library as I intentend to infrequently update it and it's built for a single purpose, but if the code interests you, please feel free to puruse.
